### Architecture Summary
```
User Query → Embedding (Sentence-Transformers) → 
Vector Search (FAISS) → Top-K Medical Docs → 
LLM Generation with Context → Answer + Citations → 
JSON Response with Confidence & Sources
```

### Innovation Points
```
1. Multi-source data ingestion (PDFs, PubMed, textbooks)
2. Inline citation system with source attribution
3. Confidence-based answer filtering (threshold > 0.75)
4. Open-source LLM support (Mistral, Qwen)
5. Automated RAGAS evaluation pipeline
6. Medical safety features (disclaimers, diagnosis refusal)
```

### Ethical Considerations
```
✅ Medical disclaimers on every response
